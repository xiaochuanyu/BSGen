Business Speak Generator
=====

A silly android app that generates phrases from coporate B.S buzzwords.

Word list comes from: http://www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html

Made using Android Studio which is in beta right now so I don't know if it will explode when you try to import.
To import in Eclipse you probably have to copy src/, res/ and android manifest into a new project (did not try this).
